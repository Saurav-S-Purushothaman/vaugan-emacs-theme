# Installation #

Download the theme to your local directory. You can do it through `git
clone` command:

```
git clone https://github.com/Saurav-S-Purushothaman/vaugan-emacs-theme.git
```

Then add path to vaugan-theme to custom-theme-load-path list â€”
add the following to your emacs config file somewhere (.emacs,
init.el, whatever):

```
(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path
             "/path/to/vaugan-emacs-theme/")
```

Use `M-x customize-themes` to change your current theme.

# Contribution #

Vaugan theme has a lack of support for many emacs mode. Feel free to add
appropriate color faces (see file chelsea-yellow-theme.el) and send me a
pull request. This help is much appreciated.

Thanks.
